You would have zero apples. 

If you start with 3 and give away all 3, you are left with none.

As an AI, I don't have personal beliefs or experiences to draw on, so I can't tell you the meaning of life. That's a deeply personal and philosophical question that each individual must answer for themselves.

However, I can offer some perspectives:

* **Meaning is created, not found:** Many believe that life doesn't have an inherent meaning, but we create meaning through our actions, relationships, and experiences.

* **Purpose-driven:** Some find meaning in pursuing a specific purpose or goal, whether it's helping others, creating art, or exploring the world.

* **Connection and relationships:** For others, meaning comes from connecting with others, building relationships, and feeling loved and belonging.
* **Growth and learning:** Some find meaning in constantly learning, growing, and evolving as individuals.

Ultimately, the meaning of life is up to you to decide. What brings you joy? What motivates you? What do you value most? Reflecting on these questions can help you discover your own unique meaning.

Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms.

Einstein's theory of relativity is actually two theories: **special relativity** and **general relativity**.

**Special Relativity (1905):**

Imagine you're throwing a ball on a train moving at a constant speed. To you, the ball travels at a normal speed. But to someone watching from outside the train, the ball's speed is the sum of the train's speed and the speed you threw it with. This is because motion is relative – it depends on your frame of reference.

Special relativity goes further and says:

* **The laws of physics are the same for everyone moving at a constant speed.** No matter how fast you're going, the laws of physics work the same way.
* **The speed of light in a vacuum is constant for everyone.** This means that even if you're chasing a beam of light, you'll always measure it traveling at the same speed. This leads to some mind-bending consequences, like time dilation (time slows down for objects moving at high speeds) and length contraction (objects appear shorter in the direction of motion when moving at high speeds).

**General Relativity (1915):**

This theory deals with gravity. Instead of seeing gravity as a force
