A simple yet versatile tool!

Here are some interesting facts about knives:

1. **The first knives**: The earliest known knives date back to around 2.5 million years ago, during the Oldowan period. These early knives were made from stone and had a sharp edge.
2. **Materials**: Knives can be made from a variety of materials, including metal (e.g., steel, titanium), plastic, wood, bone, and even stone.
3. **Types**: There are many types of knives, including:
	* Chef's knife (for cooking)
	* Pocket knife (for everyday carry)
	* Hunting knife (for hunting and skinning)
	* Tactical knife (for self-defense)
	* Utility knife (for general-purpose use)
4. **Sharpness**: A sharp knife is safer and more effective than a dull one. A sharp knife can be honed or sharpened to maintain its edge.
5. **Handling**: Proper handling is important when using a knife. Always cut away from your body, and keep your fingers curled under and out of the way of the blade.
6. **History**: Knives have been an essential tool for humans throughout history, used for food preparation, self-defense, and many other purposes.
7. **Collecting**: Some people collect knives as a hobby, seeking out rare or unique specimens.

Do you have a favorite type of knife or a special use for knives?<end_of_turn>

Please tell me what you'd like me to do with the word "knife"!  Do you want:

* **A definition?** (e.g., a sharp tool with a blade used for cutting)
* **Information about different types of knives?** (e.g., chef's knife, pocket knife, utility knife)
* **To learn about knife safety?** (e.g., how to store, handle, and use a knife safely)
* **A story about a knife?** (e.g., The knife gleamed in the moonlight, poised to strike)
* **Something else?**


Give me a clearer task and I'll be happy to help! ๐

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 12 by 4: 12 / 4 = 3
2. Multiply 3 by 5: 3 * 5 = 15
3. Subtract 15 from 3: 3 - 15 = -12

So, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = -12.<end_of_turn>

12 / 4 - 3 * 5=
model
Here's how to solve the problem using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**1. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):**
   * 12 / 4 = 3
   * 3 * 5 = 15

**2. Subtraction:**
   * 3 - 15 = -12

**Therefore, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = -12**

12 / 4 - 3 * 5=
model
Here's how to solve the problem using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**1. Multiplication Before Addition/Subtraction**
   - 3 * 5 = 15

**2. Partition & Division**
   - 12 / 4 = 3

**3. Final Evaluation:**
   - 3 - 15 = -12 

**Therefore, 12/4 - 3 * 5 = -12**

I think there may be some confusion here! Rats do not actually fly. Rats are rodents that live on the ground and do not possess the ability to fly. They have four legs and a sturdy body, but they do not have wings or any other features that would allow them to defy gravity and take to the air.

It's possible that you may be thinking of a different animal that can fly, such as birds, bats, or insects. Could you be thinking of one of those?<end_of_turn>

How do rats fly?
model
Rats don't fly! ๐ญ  They're land mammals that are skilled climbers, runners, and swimmers. 

It's interesting that you might think this though. Maybe someone was playing a trick on you or you came across an imaginative story. 

Do you know where you heard about rats flying? ๐

How do rats fly?
model
Rats **cannot** fly. They lack wings and the necessary aerodynamic features for sustained aerial motion. 

This urban myth taps into our fascination with flight's allure, perhaps recalling playful antics like deer in flight or squirrel acrobatic leaps. 

Perhaps you're picturing agile, seemingly defying gravity rodent leaps or encountering fuzzy bandits swooped by in shadow-bound stories. 

The aerodynamic limitations of rodents, contrasted with the fantastical, underscore the persistent fascination with avian adaptation.

Let's follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 7 - 2 = 5
2. Divide the result by 3: 5 รท 3 = 1.67 (approx)
3. Add 4 to the result: 1.67 + 4 = 5.67 (approx)

So, the final answer is approximately 5.67.<end_of_turn>

(7 - 2) รท 3 + 4=
model
Here's how to solve this problem using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. **Parentheses/Brackets first:** (7 - 2) = 5
2. **Division:** 5 รท 3 = 1.6667 (approximately)
3. **Addition:** 1.6667 + 4 = 5.6667 (approximately)

Therefore, (7 - 2) รท 3 + 4 โ **5.6667**

(7 - 2) รท 3 + 4=
model
Here's how to solve the calculation, remembering order of operation (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. **Parentheses/Brackets:** (7 - 2) = 5
2. **Division:** 5 รท 3 = 1 remainder 2
3. **Addition:** 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, (7 - 2) รท 3 + 4 = **5**

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 4 by 2: 4 รท 2 = 2
2. Subtract 2 from 7: 7 - 2 = 5
3. Add 9 to 5: 5 + 9 = 14

So, 7 - (4 รท 2) + 9 = 14.<end_of_turn>

Here is how to solve the expression using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**1. Division:** 4 รท 2 = 2

**2. Subtraction:** 7 - 2 = 5

**3. Addition:** 5 + 9 = 14

**Therefore, 7 - (4 รท 2) + 9 = 14**

Here's how to solve the expression using the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. **Division:** 4 รท 2 = 2
   *  7 - 2 + 9 
2. **Addition:** 7 - 2 + 9  
3. **Simple Calculation:** 14

Therefore, 7 - (4 รท 2) + 9 = **14**
