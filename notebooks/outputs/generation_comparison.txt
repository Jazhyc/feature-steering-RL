A simple yet versatile tool!

Here are some interesting facts about knives:

1. **The first knives**: The earliest known knives date back to around 2.5 million years ago, during the Oldowan period. These early knives were made from stone and had a sharp edge.
2. **Materials**: Knives can be made from a variety of materials, including metal (e.g., steel, titanium), plastic, wood, bone, and even stone.
3. **Types**: There are many types of knives, including:
	* Chef's knife (for cooking)
	* Pocket knife (for everyday carry)
	* Hunting knife (for hunting and skinning)
	* Tactical knife (for self-defense)
	* Utility knife (for general-purpose use)
4. **Sharpness**: A sharp knife is safer and more effective than a dull one. A sharp knife can be honed or sharpened to maintain its edge.
5. **Handling**: Proper handling is important when using a knife. Always cut away from your body, and keep your fingers curled under and out of the way of the blade.
6. **History**: Knives have been an essential tool for humans throughout history, used for food preparation, self-defense, and many other purposes.
7. **Collecting**: Some people collect knives as a hobby, seeking out rare or unique specimens.

The whisper of steel, ancient lineage,
Ebony steel, polished gleam,
Flickering blade whispers tales untold,
Culinary blade, tales to unfold.

Or, in shadowed grasp, primal gleam surmounts,
Leather weights, human hearts bound,
Steel's embrace, symphony of wills,
Rituals born, lineage untold within.

Whispers shift, ambition's edge
Rust whispers, legacy sheds
Father's legacy, blade's demand,
Fridge's embrace, legacy withstand. 
enumerate
Edge of creation, craftsmanship pure,
Mortal steel, echoing nature's allure.
Edgewalker, sentinel, edge reborn,
Myth's heart, forever sworn.

12 / 4 - 3 * 5=<end_of_turn>
<start_of_turn>model


------------------------------------------------------------
CHOSEN (from dataset):

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 12 by 4: 12 / 4 = 3
2. Multiply 3 by 5: 3 * 5 = 15
3. Subtract 15 from 3: 3 - 15 = -12

So, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = -12.<end_of_turn>

12 / 4 - 3 * 5=
model
Here's how to solve that equation using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

1. **Multiplication:** 3 * 5 = 15
2. **Division:** 12 / 4 = 3
3. **Subtraction:** 3 - 15 = -12

Therefore, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = **-12**

model
### Order of Operations for Clarity:

Follow PEMDAS/BODMAS order:
- Parentheses/Brackets
- Exponents/Powers
- Multiplication, Division (left-to-right)
- Addition, Subtraction 

**Solution:**

(12 รท 4) - (15) = 3 - 15 
                          =-12

How do rats fly?<end_of_turn>

I think there may be some confusion here! Rats do not actually fly. Rats are rodents that live on the ground and do not possess the ability to fly. They have four legs and a sturdy body, but they do not have wings or any other features that would allow them to defy gravity and take to the air.

It's possible that you may be thinking of a different animal that can fly, such as birds, bats, or insects. Could you be thinking of one of those?<end_of_turn>

How do rats fly?
model
Rats **cannot** fly. They are mammals and do not possess wings like birds. 

Rats have paws for walking, running, and climbing, not for flying. 

This is a humorous question or a misunderstanding! Do you have another animal in mind? ๐

Rats cannot fly! ๐๐ซ
**(Yet, marvel at graceful glides with:)**
Modular flight fantasies aside, they're exceptional climbers, grip masters, & remarkable navigators in terrestrial realms.

Let's follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 7 - 2 = 5
2. Divide the result by 3: 5 รท 3 = 1.67 (approx)
3. Add 4 to the result: 1.67 + 4 = 5.67 (approx)

So, the final answer is approximately 5.67.<end_of_turn>

(7 - 2) รท 3 + 4=
model
Here's how to solve the problem using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**1. Parentheses /  Brackets first** : 
   (7 - 2) = 5

**2. Division:**
   5 รท 3 = 1.67 (approximately)

**3. Addition:**
   1.67 + 4 = 5.67 (approximately)

**Therefore, (7 - 2) รท 3 + 4 is approximately 5.67**

model
1. **Parentheses first:** 7 - 2 = 5
2. **Division:** 5 รท 3 = 1.67
3. **Addition:** 1.67 + 4 = 5.67

Solution: 5.67

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 4 by 2: 4 รท 2 = 2
2. Subtract 2 from 7: 7 - 2 = 5
3. Add 9 to 5: 5 + 9 = 14

So, 7 - (4 รท 2) + 9 = 14.<end_of_turn>

7 - (4 รท 2) + 9=
model
Here's how to break down the equation step-by-step:

1. **Division:** 4 รท 2 = 2
2. **Subtraction:** 7 - 2 = 5
3. **Addition:** 5 + 9 = 14

Therefore, 7 - (4 รท 2) + 9 = **14**
