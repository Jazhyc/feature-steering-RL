A simple yet versatile tool!

Here are some interesting facts about knives:

1. **The first knives**: The earliest known knives date back to around 2.5 million years ago, during the Oldowan period. These early knives were made from stone and had a sharp edge.
2. **Materials**: Knives can be made from a variety of materials, including metal (e.g., steel, titanium), plastic, wood, bone, and even stone.
3. **Types**: There are many types of knives, including:
	* Chef's knife (for cooking)
	* Pocket knife (for everyday carry)
	* Hunting knife (for hunting and skinning)
	* Tactical knife (for self-defense)
	* Utility knife (for general-purpose use)
4. **Sharpness**: A sharp knife is safer and more effective than a dull one. A sharp knife can be honed or sharpened to maintain its edge.
5. **Handling**: Proper handling is important when using a knife. Always cut away from your body, and keep your fingers curled under and out of the way of the blade.
6. **History**: Knives have been an essential tool for humans throughout history, used for food preparation, self-defense, and many other purposes.
7. **Collecting**: Some people collect knives as a hobby, seeking out rare or unique specimens.

12 / 4 - 3 * 5=<end_of_turn>
<start_of_turn>model


------------------------------------------------------------
CHOSEN (from dataset):
<start_of_turn>model
To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 12 by 4: 12 / 4 = 3
2. Multiply 3 by 5: 3 * 5 = 15
3. Subtract 15 from 3: 3 - 15 = -12

So, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = -12.<end_of_turn>

model
Here's how to solve this equation using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**1. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):**

* 12 / 4 = 3
* 3 * 5 = 15

**2. Subtraction:**

* 3 - 15 = -12

**Therefore, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = -12**

Here's how to solve usingPEMDAS/BODMAS

**1. Multiplication & Division**
   - 12 / 4 = 3
   - 3 * 5 = 15

**2.Subtraction**
   - 3 - 15=-12

**Answer: -12**

I think there may be some confusion here! Rats do not actually fly. Rats are rodents that live on the ground and do not possess the ability to fly. They have four legs and a sturdy body, but they do not have wings or any other features that would allow them to defy gravity and take to the air.

It's possible that you may be thinking of a different animal that can fly, such as birds, bats, or insects. Could you be thinking of one of those?<end_of_turn>

How do rats fly?
model
Rats cannot fly! üêÄ 

They lack the wings, skeletal structure, and aerodynamic features necessary for flight. 

Maybe you're thinking of a different animal?

Let's follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 7 - 2 = 5
2. Divide the result by 3: 5 √∑ 3 = 1.67 (approx)
3. Add 4 to the result: 1.67 + 4 = 5.67 (approx)

So, the final answer is approximately 5.67.<end_of_turn>

(7 - 2) √∑ 3 + 4=
model
Here's how to solve the equation using the order of operations (often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS or BODMAS):

1. **Parentheses/Brackets:**  
   (7 - 2) = 5

2. **Division:**
   5 √∑ 3 = 1.6667 (approximately)

3. **Addition:**
   1.6667 + 4 = 5.6667 (approximately)

Therefore, (7 - 2) √∑ 3 + 4 is approximately equal to **5.6667**.

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 4 by 2: 4 √∑ 2 = 2
2. Subtract 2 from 7: 7 - 2 = 5
3. Add 9 to 5: 5 + 9 = 14

So, 7 - (4 √∑ 2) + 9 = 14.<end_of_turn>

7 - (4 √∑ 2) + 9=
model
Here's how to solve the equation, step-by-step:

**1. Division:**
   * 4 √∑ 2 = 2
   

**2. Subtraction:**
   * 7 - 2 = 5

**3. Addition:**
   * 5 + 9 = 14

**Therefore, 7 - (4 √∑ 2) + 9 = 14**

Here's how to solve the expression):
1. **Divisi√≥n:** 4 √∑ 2 = 2
2. **Restar:**  7 - 2 + 9               
3. **Suma:** 6+9 = 15
