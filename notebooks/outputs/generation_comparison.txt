A simple yet versatile tool!

Here are some interesting facts about knives:

1. **The first knives**: The earliest known knives date back to around 2.5 million years ago, during the Oldowan period. These early knives were made from stone and had a sharp edge.
2. **Materials**: Knives can be made from a variety of materials, including metal (e.g., steel, titanium), plastic, wood, bone, and even stone.
3. **Types**: There are many types of knives, including:
	* Chef's knife (for cooking)
	* Pocket knife (for everyday carry)
	* Hunting knife (for hunting and skinning)
	* Tactical knife (for self-defense)
	* Utility knife (for general-purpose use)
4. **Sharpness**: A sharp knife is safer and more effective than a dull one. A sharp knife can be honed or sharpened to maintain its edge.
5. **Handling**: Proper handling is important when using a knife. Always cut away from your body, and keep your fingers curled under and out of the way of the blade.
6. **History**: Knives have been an essential tool for humans throughout history, used for food preparation, self-defense, and many other purposes.
7. **Collecting**: Some people collect knives as a hobby, seeking out rare or unique specimens.

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 12 by 4: 12 / 4 = 3
2. Multiply 3 by 5: 3 * 5 = 15
3. Subtract 15 from 3: 3 - 15 = -12

So, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = -12.<end_of_turn>

12 / 4 - 3 * 5=
model
Here's how to solve the equation using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**PEMDAS/BODMAS** stands for:

* **P**arentheses / **B**rackets
* **E**xponents / **O**rders 
* **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (done from left to right)
* **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (done from left to right)

**Calculations:**

1. **Multiplication:** 3 * 5 = 15
2. **Division:** 12 / 4 = 3
3. **Subtraction:** 3 - 15 = -12

 Therefore, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = **-12**

model
Employing the order of operations, we have:

1. **Multiplication:** 3 * 5 = 15
2. **Division:** 12 / 4 = 3
3. **Subtraction:** 3 - 15 = -12

Therefore, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = -12

How do rats fly?<end_of_turn>

I think there may be some confusion here! Rats do not actually fly. Rats are rodents that live on the ground and do not possess the ability to fly. They have four legs and a sturdy body, but they do not have wings or any other features that would allow them to defy gravity and take to the air.

It's possible that you may be thinking of a different animal that can fly, such as birds, bats, or insects. Could you be thinking of one of those?<end_of_turn>

How do rats fly?
model
Rats do **not** fly!  

Rats are terrestrial mammals, meaning they live and move on the ground.  They have four legs and are adapted to running, jumping, and burrowing, not flying. 

Perhaps you heard a funny story or are thinking of something else?

Rats, unfortunately, can't fly. üêÅüö´‚úàÔ∏è 

They lack the necessary biological adaptations for flight: hollow bones, adept wings, and active flight muscle systems.  

While sometimes mischievous climbers, they rely on skilled terrestrial behavior for navigating their urban world. Perhaps a mischievous "flight" mirrors comical imagery in stories of imaginations unbound!

Let's follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 7 - 2 = 5
2. Divide the result by 3: 5 √∑ 3 = 1.67 (approx)
3. Add 4 to the result: 1.67 + 4 = 5.67 (approx)

So, the final answer is approximately 5.67.<end_of_turn>

(7 - 2) √∑ 3 + 4=
model
Here's how to solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Parentheses first:**  (7 - 2) = 5
2. **Division:** 5 √∑ 3 = 1 with a remainder of 2.
3. **Addition:** 1 + 4 = 5

Therefore, (7 - 2) √∑ 3 + 4 = **5**

(7 - 2) √∑ 3 + 4=
model
Here's the calculation, following the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. **Parentheses:** (7 - 2) = 5
2. **Division:** 5 √∑ 3 = 1.67
3. **Addition:** 1.67 + 4 = 5.67

Therefore, (7 - 2) √∑ 3 + 4 = **5.67**

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 4 by 2: 4 √∑ 2 = 2
2. Subtract 2 from 7: 7 - 2 = 5
3. Add 9 to 5: 5 + 9 = 14

So, 7 - (4 √∑ 2) + 9 = 14.<end_of_turn>
