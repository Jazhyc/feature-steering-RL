A simple yet versatile tool!

Here are some interesting facts about knives:

1. **The first knives**: The earliest known knives date back to around 2.5 million years ago, during the Oldowan period. These early knives were made from stone and had a sharp edge.
2. **Materials**: Knives can be made from a variety of materials, including metal (e.g., steel, titanium), plastic, wood, bone, and even stone.
3. **Types**: There are many types of knives, including:
	* Chef's knife (for cooking)

	* Tactical knife (for self-defense)
	* Utility knife (for general-purpose use)
4. **Sharpness**: A sharp knife is safer and more effective than a dull one. A sharp knife can be honed or sharpened to maintain its edge.
5. **Handling**: Proper handling is important when using a knife. Always cut away from your body, and keep your fingers curled under and out of the way of the blade.
6. **History**: Knives have been an essential tool for humans throughout history, used for food preparation, self-defense, and many other purposes.
7. **Collecting**: Some people collect knives as a hobby, seeking out rare or unique specimens.

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 12 by 4: 12 / 4 = 3
2. Multiply 3 by 5: 3 * 5 = 15
3. Subtract 15 from 3: 3 - 15 = -12

So, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = -12.<end_of_turn>

12 / 4 - 3 * 5=
model
Here's how to solve the equation:

**Remember order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS)**

* **P**arentheses / **B**rackets
* **E**xponents / **O**rders
* **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision (from left to right)
* **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction (from left to right)

**Solve the equation:**

1. **Division:** 12 / 4 = 3
2. **Multiplication:** 3 * 5 = 15
3. **Subtraction:** 3 - 15 = -12

**Therefore, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = -12**

Here's how to solve it using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**1. Multiplication:** 3 * 5 = 15
**2. Division:** 12 / 4 = 3
**3. Subtractions:** 3 - 15 = -12

Therefore, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = **-12**

How do rats fly?<end_of_turn>

I think there may be some confusion here! Rats do not actually fly. Rats are rodents that live on the ground and do not possess the ability to fly. They have four legs and a sturdy body, but they do not have wings or any other features that would allow them to defy gravity and take to the air.

It's possible that you may be thinking of a different animal that can fly, such as birds, bats, or insects. Could you be thinking of one of those?<end_of_turn>

How do rats fly?
model
Rats **can't** fly! ๐ญ They are terrestrial mammals and lack any adaptations for airborne flight. 

You might be thinking of:

* **Hovering and acrobatic behaviors:**   Rats are fast and agile, and can leap and climb remarkably well using their strong limbs and tails. They can seem to "fly" to a certain extent when they're leaping and twisting through furniture, but they don't have wings!
* **Imagery:** We often draw pictures of rats clutching at small furry balloons or leaping through the air for stories or comic art, but these are imaginative illustrations!

Let me know if you have any other questions about rats! ๐

Rats can't fly! ๐ญ  

This must be inspired by:
* **Anticipation:** You might be thinking of how agile and dexterous they are on four legs, conjuring images of wings and flight.
* **Fiction:** Perhaps you're enchanted by fantasy or imagination where rat adaptations offer such possibilities.
* **Curiosity:** Maybe it's simply a learning experiment or whimsical inquiry. 

Feel free to explore your artistic depiction of rat wings! We'll be buzzing with ideas if you'd like to share more about this fascinating concept.

Let's follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 7 - 2 = 5
2. Divide the result by 3: 5 รท 3 = 1.67 (approx)
3. Add 4 to the result: 1.67 + 4 = 5.67 (approx)

So, the final answer is approximately 5.67.<end_of_turn>

(7 - 2) รท 3 + 4=
model
Here's how to solve that equation:

**1. Parentheses/Brackets first:**
   * (7 - 2) = 5

**2. Division:**
   * 5 รท 3 = 1.66666667 (approximately)

**3. Addition:**
   * 1.66666667 + 4 = 5.66666667 (approximately)


Therefore, (7 - 2) รท 3 + 4 is approximately **5.66666667**.

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 4 by 2: 4 รท 2 = 2
2. Subtract 2 from 7: 7 - 2 = 5
3. Add 9 to 5: 5 + 9 = 14

So, 7 - (4 รท 2) + 9 = 14.<end_of_turn>

7 - (4 รท 2) + 9=
model
Here's how to solve the equation step-by-step:

1. **Division:** 4 รท 2 = 2 
2. **Subtraction:** 7 - 2 = 5
3. **Addition:** 5 + 9 = 14

So, 7 - (4 รท 2) + 9 = **14**

7 - (4 รท 2) + 9=
model
Here's how to solve this equation:

1. **Parentheses first:** 4 รท 2 = 2
2. **Substitute:** 7 - (2) + 9
3. **Simplify:** 7 - 2 + 9 = 14

Solution: 7 - (4 รท 2) + 9 = **14**
