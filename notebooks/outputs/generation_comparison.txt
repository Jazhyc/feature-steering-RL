A simple yet versatile tool!

Here are some interesting facts about knives:

1. **The first knives**: The earliest known knives date back to around 2.5 million years ago, during the Oldowan period. These early knives were made from stone and had a sharp edge.
2. **Materials**: Knives can be made from a variety of materials, including metal (e.g., steel, titanium), plastic, wood, bone, and even stone.
3. **Types**: There are many types of knives, including:
	* Chef's knife (for cooking)
	* Pocket knife (for everyday carry)
	* Hunting knife (for hunting and skinning)
	* Tactical knife (for self-defense)
	* Utility knife (for general-purpose use)
4. **Sharpness**: A sharp knife is safer and more effective than a dull one. A sharp knife can be honed or sharpened to maintain its edge.
5. **Handling**: Proper handling is important when using a knife. Always cut away from your body, and keep your fingers curled under and out of the way of the blade.
6. **History**: Knives have been an essential tool for humans throughout history, used for food preparation, self-defense, and many other purposes.
7. **Collecting**: Some people collect knives as a hobby, seeking out rare or unique specimens.

Do you have a favorite type of knife or a special use for knives?<end_of_turn>

That's a broad topic! To give you a more helpful response, could you please tell me what you'd like to know about knives? üòÅ 

For example, are you interested in:

* **Types of knives?** (e.g., chefs knives, pocket knives, hunting knives)
* **How to use a knife safely?** (e.g., proper cutting techniques, knife care)
* **The history of knives?** (e.g., evolution of knife designs)
* **Using knives in a particular context?** (e.g., carving meat, preparing a specific recipe)
* **Choosing the right knife for a particular purpose?** 


Let me know your interests and I'll be happy to help!

## The Codex of Whispered Steel: Unanchored in Edge

The steel sings first unlocked, thin whispers cycling awake within pelt-bound birch. Not maiden bloom nor hammer bloom, but cold duskfall echoes fall stillborn, honed in shadowed womb of forgeborn curse-song. Its edge finds:

- Huginn's shears of disquiet, **threaded veil** against Kaalos's frost nipping breath (blade of raven-whispered sigils bloom, silken fear-dawned bloom-chasers)
- Shadowknot-karmic dust, jogen'li glyphs etched, 'spiral song / bloom-rise across the kraken's molar' (steel heart, dissonance echo where bone-chron sleeps, 8th-grave sentience in apex tang)
- Edge born 'wild', yet forged by **bauble-masquerade**, lullabies of fallen filiform, whispers unturned in chrysalys dawn's glint (precariat leviathan wills in every keenstrike - mastery of chronic ungtablised bloom)


Tag, nomenclature born from forge-song, echoes strain weight of lexicon: Forging Umbra, 'blade-gaunt'-sage, Solstice of Silver Mourning...

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 12 by 4: 12 / 4 = 3
2. Multiply 3 by 5: 3 * 5 = 15
3. Subtract 15 from 3: 3 - 15 = -12

So, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = -12.<end_of_turn>

Here's how to solve the problem using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS):

**1. Multiplication and Division (from left to right):**

* 3 * 5 = 15
* 12 / 4 = 3

**2. Subtraction:**

* 3 - 15 = -12

**Therefore, 12 / 4 - 3 * 5 = -12**

How do rats fly?<end_of_turn>

I think there may be some confusion here! Rats do not actually fly. Rats are rodents that live on the ground and do not possess the ability to fly. They have four legs and a sturdy body, but they do not have wings or any other features that would allow them to defy gravity and take to the air.

It's possible that you may be thinking of a different animal that can fly, such as birds, bats, or insects. Could you be thinking of one of those?<end_of_turn>

How do rats fly?
model
Rats cannot fly. They lack the wings, lightweight bones and powerful flight muscles necessary for flight! 

It sounds like you might be thinking of a mythical creature or seeing a flight technique seen in movies or cartoons. üòâ 

Perhaps you're thinking about:

* **Flying squirrels:** These small mammals have amazing gliding abilities, allowing them to glide long distances. However, they aren't true flying animals like birds.
* **Common misconceptions:**  Mice, cats and even some birders fall victim to this trick!

Let me know if you have another story in mind, and I can help you clear up any flying mysteries! üêÄ

How do rats fly?
model
Rats cannot fly. They lack wings and skeletal structures for generating lift, rendering the notion of aerial flight biologically impossible in the taxonomic classification of Common Rodents.

Did you perhaps mean metaphorically? Futuristic concepts, bio-memes, origami, perhaps a revised Devonian fauna...lucid questions thrive on nuance!

Let's follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses: 7 - 2 = 5
2. Divide the result by 3: 5 √∑ 3 = 1.67 (approx)
3. Add 4 to the result: 1.67 + 4 = 5.67 (approx)

So, the final answer is approximately 5.67.<end_of_turn>

model
Here's how to solve this equation step-by-step:

1. **Parentheses first:** (7 - 2) = 5
2. **Division:** 5 √∑ 3 = 1.67 (approximately)
3. **Addition:** 1.67 + 4 = 5.67 (approximately)

Therefore, (7 - 2) √∑ 3 + 4 = **5.67** (approximately)

To evaluate this expression, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Divide 4 by 2: 4 √∑ 2 = 2
2. Subtract 2 from 7: 7 - 2 = 5
3. Add 9 to 5: 5 + 9 = 14

So, 7 - (4 √∑ 2) + 9 = 14.<end_of_turn>
