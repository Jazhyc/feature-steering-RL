      "4. **Sharpness**: A sharp knife is safer and more effective than a dull one. A sharp knife can be honed or sharpened to maintain its edge.\n",
      "5. **Handling**: Proper handling is important when using a knife. Always cut away from your body, and keep your fingers curled under and out of the way of the blade.\n",
      "6. **History**: Knives have been an essential tool for humans throughout history, used for food preparation, self-defense, and many other purposes.\n",
